# Installing text mod

> [!WARNING]
> Text mod no longer works.

1. [Click this link to download the file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xPaw/CS2/main/csgo_textmod.txt) (Press <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd>)
2. Go to this folder: `Steam\SteamApps\Common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\resource`
3. Create new folder: `subtitles`
4. Put the downloaded file in that folder and name it `closecaption_english.txt`

It should look like this: `game\csgo\resource\subtitles\closecaption_english.txt`

To enable letters inside of a circle for teammate colors, use `cl_teammate_colors_show 2`

This was based on bananagaming text mod, but I have been modifying it over the years for CS:GO.
